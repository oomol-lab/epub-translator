...  small period of time is the moment. Newton further observed that “the moments of the fluent quantities . . . are as their speeds of flow” (i.e., as the fluxions).12 His reasoning is based on the idea that during an “infinitely small period of time” the fluxion remains constant, and therefore the moment is proportional to the fluxion.

The notation Newton developed for this was rather awkward; it was not until the 1690s that he introduced a now standard notation: the moment of time is o, the fluxion of x is denoted by , and the moment of x by o. The fluxions themselves can be considered fluent quantities, and hence they too have fluxions. In the 1690s Newton denoted the “second” fluxion of x by .

Newton gives the basic algorithm for calculating fluxions by means of an example. He considers the equation:

(1)

He substitutes x + o in place of x and y + o in place of y and expands the powers. Deleting x3 - ax2 + axy - y3 as equal to zero and dividing through by o, he obtains an equation from which he cancels the terms which have o as a factor. In fact, these terms “will be equivalent to nothing in respect to the others,” since “o is supposed to be infinitely small.”13 At last Newton arrives at:

(2)

a relation from which the ratio / defining the tangent to the curve expressed by equation (1) can be obtained.

This result is achieved by employing the rule of cancellation of infinitesimals. In fact, Newton assumes that during the infinitesimal interval of time o the motion is uniform, so that when x flows to x + o, y flows to y + o. He then applies the principle of cancellation of infinitesimals, so in the last step the terms in o are dropped. His justification for this procedure is not much more rigorous than that offered for similar algorithms earlier in the century, such as those by Hudde and Sluse in the commentaries to Descartes’s Geometria. As we will see, Newton was soon to face some serious foundational questions.

In the Method, Newton gives the solution of a series of problems “in illustration of this analytical art,” mainly problems of maxima and minima, tangents, curvatures, areas, surfaces, volumes, and arc lengths. With quantities represented as generated by continuous flow, all of these problems can be reduced to the following two (one the inverse of the other):

Given the length of the space at every time, to find the speed of motion at any proposed time.

Given the speed of motion at every time, to find the length of the space described at any proposed time.14

This is among the greatest generalizations in the history of mathematics, reducing the great majority of problems faced by mathematicians of the time to two basic problems. Today’s students are accustomed to tackling an impressively large class of problems through the differential and integral calculus. They also know that differentiation and integration are inverse operations, a fact established in the second half of the seventeenth century by Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz independently.

In 1671 Newton was thus in possession of a mathematical method which allowed him to supersede all his contemporaries. Just after completing the Method of Fluxions and Infinite Series, Newton drafted an addendum15 in which a “more natural approach” was presented, ...

... 一小段时间就是瞬。牛顿进一步观察到，“流量的瞬……与它们流动的速度成正比”（即与流数成正比）。他的推理基于这样的想法：在“无限小的一段时间”内，流数保持不变，因此瞬与流数成正比。

牛顿为此发明的符号相当笨拙；直到1690年代，他才引入了一种现在标准的符号：时间的瞬是o，x的流数用表示，x的瞬用o表示。流数本身可以被视为流量，因此它们也有流数。在1690年代，牛顿用表示x的“第二”流数。

牛顿通过一个例子给出了计算流数的基本算法。他考虑方程：

(1)

他用x + o代替x，用y + o代替y，并展开幂次。删除等于零的x3 - ax2 + axy - y3，并除以o，他得到一个方程，从中消去含有o因子的项。实际上，这些项“相对于其他项将等于零”，因为“o被假定为无限小”。最终牛顿得到：

(2)

从这个关系可以得到定义由方程(1)表示的曲线切线的比值/。

这一结果是通过运用无穷小消去法则实现的。实际上，牛顿假设在无穷小的时间间隔o内，运动是均匀的，因此当x流动到x + o时，y流动到y + o。然后他应用无穷小消去原理，因此在最后一步中，含有o的项被舍弃。他对这一过程的辩护并不比本世纪早期为类似算法（如胡德和斯吕塞在笛卡尔《几何学》评注中提出的算法）提供的论证更严谨。正如我们将看到的，牛顿很快将面临一些严重的基础性问题。

在《方法》中，牛顿给出了一系列问题的解，“以说明这种分析技巧”，主要是最大值和最小值、切线、曲率、面积、表面积、体积和弧长问题。通过将量表示为连续流动生成，所有这些问题都可以归结为以下两个问题（互为逆运算）：

给定每个时刻的空间长度，求任意给定时刻的运动速度。

给定每个时刻的运动速度，求任意给定时刻所描述的空间长度。

这是数学史上最伟大的概括之一，将当时数学家面临的大部分问题简化为两个基本问题。今天的学生习惯于通过微分和积分学处理数量惊人的一大类问题。他们也知​​道微分和积分是互逆运算，这一事实在十七世纪下半叶由牛顿和戈特弗里德·威廉·莱布尼茨各自独立确立。

因此，在1671年，牛顿掌握了一种数学方法，使他能够超越所有同时代的人。就在完成《流数法与无穷级数》后不久，牛顿起草了一个附录，其中提出了一种“更自然的方法”，……
