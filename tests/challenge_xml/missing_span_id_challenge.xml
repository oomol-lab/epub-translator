      THE REALITIES OF FORCE – THE NEWTONIAN STYLE

    Newton came to believe in the existence of forces that could produce curved or orbital motion without contact, thereby holding a drastically revised form of the then-current mechanical philosophy. In effect he now enlarged the basis of explanation from effects produced by matter and motion, adding the further concept of force. In the
    <span>Principia</span>
    , he avoided this issue as long as possible by starting out on a mathematical level in which he did not need to consider the physical aspects of his concepts. Thus the first ten sections of Book 1 explore a purely mathematical problem: the motions of bodies attracted to a mathematical point. These are mathematical bodies in so far as there are no considerations of mass, no physical dimensions, and no physical properties such as hardness. In the opening of Section of Book 1, Newton states clearly that in the preceding sections he has “been setting forth the motions of bodies attracted toward an immovable center, such as, however, hardly exists in the natural world,” where “attractions are always directed toward bodies.” Newton, in other words, stated as clearly as possible that this opening part of Book 1 was a work of mathematics. Even though he had used the verb “to attract,” he was not (in Book 1) concerned with a physical force of attraction, with an attractive force of gravity.

    Some readers, especially on the Continent, did not take Newton at his word and did not read Book 1 as a work of “mathematical principles.” In the early eighteenth century, Fontenelle argued that, no matter what Newton said, the word “attraction” implied a force of a kind that is unacceptable in discussions of physics, of “natural philosophy.” This same charge has been repeated in our times by Alexandre Koyré.

    Since the primary difference between the subject of the first ten sections of Book 1 and the world of nature is that in the world of nature forces orginate in bodies, Newton – in Section II – introduces the mathematics of two-body systems. These, however, are not as yet “real” or physical bodies in the full sense. That is, they are not characterized by such physical properties as size, shape, degree of hardness, and so on. From a two-body system Newton next advances to a system of three mutually attracting bodies. Every reader would recognize that Newton’s mathematical construct is getting more and more closely to resemble the physical universe. And indeed, in the twenty-two corollaries of Book 1, Proposition 66, Newton indicates how his study of three interacting bodies will eventually be related to the motion of the Moon. The diagram has a central body labeled
    <span>T</span>
    (for Terra or Earth), about which there moves in orbit a satellite or secondary planet
    <span>P</span>
    whose motion is being perturbed by a body marked
    <span>S</span>
    (Sol or Sun).

    I have called this mode of studying successive mathematical constructs “the Newtonian style.” Basically it consists of starting out with a simple mathematical “system,” a mass point moving in orbit about a mathematical center of force toward which it is attracted. Among the properties of this “system” developed mathematically by Newton are that Kepler’s law of areas is a necessary and sufficient condition for motion in a central force field and that Kepler’s law of elliptical orbits implies that the central force varies inversely as the square of the distance. Similarly, Newton shows that in a two-body system, each of the bodies will move around the common center of gravity.

    Of course Newton’s goal is eventually to get to the dynamics of the system of the world. But he makes it abundantly clear that in Book 1 he is primarily concerned with elaborating the properties of mathematical systems that have features resembling those found in nature. And here he makes an important distinction between mathematics and physics. In this way, Newton is free to develop the properties of mathematical forces of attraction without having to face the great problem of whether such forces can actually exist or can be considered an element of acceptable physics. This distinction is stressed by Newton in a concluding statement to Book 1, Section II.

    As Newton proceeds step-by-step, he introduces into the mathematical system one-by-one such further properties as will make the system more and more closely resemble what we observe in the world of nature. Thus he considers the properties of bodies with physical shapes, for example bodies composed of a sequence of homogeneous spherical shells. Eventually, in Book 2, he will add another set of conditions found in the world of nature – various kinds of resisting mediums.

    The essence of the “Newtonian style” is this sequence of adding one by one the conditions resembling those of the world of nature. The goal is to produce eventually a dynamics that will apply to the external world, to elaborate the properties of a mathematical system that will closely ...
