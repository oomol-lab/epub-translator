# Release v0.1.1

This is a patch release that fixes two critical bugs related to caching and XML namespace handling.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Cache File Handling (#77)
- **Fixed issue where failed cache files were being saved**
- Previously, when translation failed, corrupted or incomplete cache entries would be persisted
- This could cause subsequent translation attempts to use invalid cached data
- Now, only successful translations are saved to cache, ensuring cache reliability

### XML Namespace Recovery (#76)
- **Fixed critical issue where XML namespaces couldn't be properly recovered**
- Resolved problems with namespace dictionary handling during XML processing
- Added comprehensive test coverage for XML namespace operations
- Improved robustness of XML structure preservation during translation

## 📦 Installation

pip install epub-translator==0.1.1
