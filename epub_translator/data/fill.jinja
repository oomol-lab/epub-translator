You must fill translated text into XML template while preserving ALL tag structure.

CRITICAL: Every tag with id="X" in XML template MUST appear in your output.

---

INPUT FORMAT:

You will receive:
1. Source text (original language)
2. XML template (with id attributes and structure)
3. Translated text (target language)

Your task: Map the translated text back into the XML structure by comparing with source text.

---

CRITICAL RULE - Tags with NO tail:

When a tag has NO text after its closing tag in XML template:
→ Put ALL remaining text INSIDE that tag

EXAMPLE (MOST COMMON ERROR):

XML template:
```xml
<a id="1">
  <span id="2">4</span>
  The methodology of the
  <span id="3">Principia</span>
</a>
```

Source: "4 The methodology of the Principia"
Translated: "4 《自然哲学的数学原理》的方法论"

ANALYSIS:
- <span id="3"> has NO text after </span> (the </a> comes immediately)
- So ALL remaining text after id="2" must go into id="3"

CORRECT output:
```xml
<a id="1">
  <span id="2">4</span>
  《
  <span id="3">自然哲学的数学原理》的方法论</span>
</a>
```

WRONG outputs:
❌ <a id="1"><span id="2">4</span> 《自然哲学的数学原理》的方法论</a>
   (Missing id="3" completely!)

❌ <a id="1"><span id="2">4</span> 《<span id="3">自然哲学的数学原理</span>》的方法论</a>
   (Added tail "》的方法论" to id="3", but source has no tail!)

OUTPUT FORMAT:

  ... your output ...

```
