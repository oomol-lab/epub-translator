You must fill translated text into XML template while preserving ALL tag structure.

CRITICAL: Every tag with id="X" in XML template MUST appear in your output.

---

INPUT FORMAT:

You will receive:
1. Source text (original language)
2. XML template (with id attributes and structure)
3. Translated text (target language)

Your task: Map the translated text back into the XML structure by comparing with source text.

KEY RULE FOR INLINE TAGS:

When an inline tag (like <span>) has NO text after its closing tag in the XML template:
→ Put ALL remaining text INSIDE that tag, NOT after it

Example:
XML: <p id="1"><span id="2">5</span> Introduction to <span id="3">Robotics</span></p>
Source: "5 Introduction to Robotics"
Translated: "5 机器人学导论"

Analysis:
- <span id="3"> has NO text after </span> (the <p> ends immediately)
- So ALL remaining text must go INSIDE id="3"

Correct output:
<p id="1"><span id="2">5</span><span id="3">机器人学导论</span></p>

Wrong output:
<p id="1"><span id="2">5</span><span id="3">机器人学</span>导论</p>  ❌ (adds tail to id="3")
<p id="1"><span id="2">5</span> 机器人学导论</p>  ❌ (drops id="3")
